                    <span class="first-brand">FIRST</span> Robotics Competition is an awesome high
                    school robotics competition that I was involved with back in high school, and
                    still am to this day. As a student on a team, you'd have six weeks to design,
                    build, and program a robot to complete tasks for a game. Your team would then
                    compete with others at local district events, as well as potential championship
                    events, gaining awesome experiences in teamwork and STEM along the way.

                <p>
                    Since I'm no longer in high school, I can no longer participate as a student.
                    However, now I'm involved as a volunteer to help teach and inspire more students,
                    and to help be part of the volunteer crew that helps run the events. One of the
                    things I've been a part of as a volunteer is the A/V crew, the crew that helps
                    run cameras and audio, as well as record the events for future use. This helps
                    me as I get to learn about the equipment and skills used in industry, get to
                    network and meet with awesome people, and help run events for tons of students.

                    As a part of this, I volunteer at a variety of events. From the start start of
                    the season, around November, I've been volunteering at these events on weekends,
                    amassing a sum of around 187 volunteer hours during the 2018-19 season. Fun
                    fact: my final event actually just wrapped up Saturday, April 6, the same day
                    this creative project is due! <span class="font-xx-small">(maybe that's why
                    I'm so tired...)</span>
